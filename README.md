# About ❓
### You are currently on the ```stable-bundles``` branch. For ```dev-bundles``` branch go [here](https://github.com/Jman-Github/ReVanced-Patch-Bundle-JSONs/tree/dev-bundles).
This repository gets manually updated within 24 hours of a patch or integrations updates from the repositorys listed below. This repository is used for the patch bundles sources in the ReVanced Conpose Manager. The [stable-patches](https://github.com/Jman-Github/ReVanced-Patch-Bundle-JSONs/tree/stable-bundles) branch is for all stable versions of patches and integrations, dev versions will not be added once they release, only stable. The [dev-bundles](https://github.com/Jman-Github/ReVanced-Patch-Bundle-JSONs/tree/dev-bundles) branch is for all dev versions of patches and integrations, stable versions will not be added once they release, only dev.

Use these links to set your patch bundles inside the ReVanced Compose Manager. These are stable patch and integration links, not dev. Go [here](https://github.com/Jman-Github/ReVanced-Patch-Bundle-JSONs/tree/dev-bundles) for dev patch and integration links and information. The manager should update the bundles every time these links have a change in their code.
